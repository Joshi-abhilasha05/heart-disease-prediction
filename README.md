## Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning classification algorithms. Multiple models are trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate approach for early heart disease detection.

### Features:
* Data preprocessing and feature selection
* Training and comparison of multiple ML models
* Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics
* User-friendly prediction workflow

### Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Logistic Regression
* Grid Search & Random Search (for hyperparameter tuning)

### Technologies Used:
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

### Dataset:
* Publicly available heart disease dataset
* Includes clinical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate

### Objective:
To assist in early detection of heart disease by applying and comparing different machine learning algorithms and selecting the best-performing model.
